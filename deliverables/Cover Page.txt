(a) Status: Complete
(b) Time Spent: 40-50 hours
(c) I wish that we were told more tiny details about the project.
    There wasn't really anything that I didn't learn from emailing Luca though.
    Most things were pretty clear. I don't really understand whats different from
    the experimental plan and the design, so I wish it said more about what we needed for
    the Results/Analysis.
